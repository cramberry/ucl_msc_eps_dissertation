Dissertation data and code repository for MSc in Environment, Politics and Society at UCL (2018)

I hope this is anonymous enough!
In this repository I am keeping all the data that I found or collected for my dissertation. 
The subject is the relationship between power, Ethiopian Airlines and the state. 

Data is quantitative and qualitative. There are some maps too. 

I have used r to analyse any quantitative data, and to make the maps. 

I'm a beginner with this whole coding stuff, so bear with me.
